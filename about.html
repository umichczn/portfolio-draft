				<p class="col-12 text-center">Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 in Tokyo by the three men, Isao Takahata, Toshio Suzuki and the film producer Hayao Miyazaki. The name Studio Ghibli was based on the Arabic name for "hot sahara wind" because the founders wanted Studio Ghibli to blow new wind through the anime industry. At the same time Ghibli was also the name of an Italian war plane and therefore it also represented Hayao Miyazaki's love for planes and for Italy.Before Miyazaki worked for Ghibli he had already directed a few films like Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro and Future Boy Conan. The first original movie directed by Miyazaki was Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind in 1984.</p>

							<p class="tm-feature-description">Takahata's films had a major influence on Hayao Miyazaki, prompting animator Yasuo Ōtsuka to suggest that Miyazaki learned his sense of social responsibility from Takahata and that without him, Miyazaki would probably have been interested in comic book material.[24] As with Miyazaki, Takahata and Michel Ocelot were great admirers of each other's work. Ocelot names Takahata's Grave of the Fireflies and Pom Poko among his favorite films</p>

							<p class="tm-feature-description">Miyazaki has frequently been cited as an inspiration to numerous animators, directors and writers around the world, including Guillermo del Toro, Pete Docter, Glen Keane.Keane said Miyazaki is a "huge influence" on Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been "part of our heritage" ever since The Rescuers Down Under (1990). When animating young children, Miyazaki often takes inspiration from his friends' children, as well as memories of his own childhood.</p>
